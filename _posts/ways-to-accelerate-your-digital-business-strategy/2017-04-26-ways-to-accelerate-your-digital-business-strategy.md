Implementing a digital business strategy is important but it doesn't need to be difficult. Automation can make your digital transformation even more effective and can speed up the process making your business more successful. With the boundaries between the virtual and physical worlds become less apparent, every business, no matter the industry, needs to be a digital business. Creating an effective digital business strategy will enable you to leverage new technology in all aspects and allow you to create new business models and new end user experiences. Although becoming a digital business is not a one-time event and it should be viewed as a continuous process of digitalization, [transformation](/no-one-understands-digital-transformation-heres-why/){:target="_blank"} and re-transformation, many business owners are searching for ways to accelerate this process and create solid digital business strategies that are ready made to their needs.

Creating a digital business strategy in this manner, and as quickly as possible, does have its risks including business disruption. By using automation and artificial intelligence solutions, these risks can be managed and your business can grow into a successful digital business. Here are some ways that you can accelerate your digital business strategy and make the digital transformation:

## 1) Understand critical business processes:

Before the digital transformation can occur, a business owner or manager needs to understand their current business processes and the enterprise applications that make them work.  If your business has been around for a while, many of those processes may not be available or they are out of date. Rather than having them recreated manually, choose automated business process discovery software to help create business process documents in real-time and keep them continuously updated and accurate as your business processes change.

## 2) Automate early and often:

Many business processes are updated daily or even multiple times per day. Updating these processes manually would be expensive and time consuming. Using automated business process software in this application enables you to routinely check 500,000+ business process steps in a matter of hours using multiple virtual machines.  This automation technology enables the business owner or manager to deploy new solutions quickly and automatically without any compromise to quality or business process coverage.

## 3) Blur the boundaries between business and IT: 

Earlier we stated that the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds are becoming less clear and this can also be compared with the boundaries between business and IT. While more and more business owners are deciding which enterprise applications are needed, IT professionals need to integrate them properly which means that they must understand more of the business. This also requires the business to understand more of the technology. True collaboration between business and IT should be considered indispensable and this collaboration relies on communication.

## 4) Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze & optimize: 

Capturing end-user interactions with your enterprise applications can uncover a wealth of information about how business is conducted.  Artificial intelligence techniques can then be used on the vast amount of data collected to look for patterns, problems, and failures and to automatically identify areas where more attention should be focused. This can add more business value or can fix something that doesn't work.

The business owner's focus should be on running the business rather than sifting through vast amounts of information provided by individual enterprise apps. Artificial intelligence techniques can optimise all aspects of critical business processes and can save the business owner both time and money.

## 5) Create a Center of Excellence (COE): 

Creating a center of excellence is one of the most powerful and important things a business owner can do to support their digital business strategy. This must be done from the beginning because if you don't plan for success initially, your business digital transformation will not be successful. The move to digital business means change – and the downside of change is technology risk and business disruption of a rapidly changing environment. To accelerate your innovation and digitalization projects will require a proven methodology and automation tools to ensure the continued quality of every business process as you make the transition to digital business.  The COE becomes the focal point for building and maintaining your competency in these critical areas.

Transforming into a digital can be a difficult task for both business owner or manager and their IT department. But using the above solutions to automate business process discovery, analytics and testing, blurring the boundaries between business and IT, and establishing a center of excellence will accelerate the transformation process and lead to success.

For any business to succeed and grow in the digital world, they must become an integral part of it. From the most basic of business processes, to some of the more intricate processes of any business, automation is key and Logic Room can provide your company with the web and mobile software it needs for a successful digital transformation.
