    <h4 class="center">"If your code isn't clean and maintainable your business is disadvantaged!"</h4>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>Logic Room is a software consultancy that was created because it’s founders had enough of the poor quality code and exponential costs organisations to incur when code bases aren’t maintained properly. Late releases, excessive bugs, high developer churn rates and the constant need to rewrite entire applications (what is that all about?)!</p>

    <p>Well... we’ve seen pretty much every new movement in the software industry, Agile, Continuous Delivery, Cloud and now of course the area we specialise in... Digital Transformation. Here’s the thing with trends, the technology industry loves them. And understandably they provide a way to create a wrapper around a problem, a way to describe it and deal with it, but if you peel them back you find two fundamental topics; Code Quality and Automation. Your business knowledge is contained in your code, it literally underpins your effectiveness as a business without clean, clear and concise code you can’t progress and without automation you won't ever be able to quickly adapt, and you can’t do the most important thing you are aiming to do in business - make money!</p>

    <p>Our consultancy seeks to add value to clients long term Digital Strategy by proving a simple model of quality assurance which is backed up though the way we organise ourselves. When you engage with us the first thing you get is a professional technical leader who is responsible for 4 things :</p>

      <li>Tracking and keeping the client aware of progress</li>
      <li>Supporting The Development Team</li>
    </ul>
