  <h2 class="text-dark-grey"> High Quality Bespoke Mobile App Development Services </h2>

  <p> We specialise in creating durable and flexible mobile software based on the emerging <a target="_blank"
                                                                                              href="/javascript-is-the-future-of-application-development/">JavaScript</a>
    ecosystem of technologies. We develop mobile apps using JavaScript technologies because then the client can pay up
    to 50% less to have both IOS and Android mobile apps developed using a single code base.</p>

  <p> We are also leaders in Rapid Application Development (RAD) techniques that help our clients prototype their ideas
    with us and learn fast.
  </p>

  <p> We enable our clients to grow their business faster because we actually work with on them on projects and take the
    time to challenge and test assumptions about what will work. Software development is expensive; we help you control
    costs by delivering software that will actually be used.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-dark-grey">Using React Native For IOS and Android Mobile App Development</h2>

  <p> We were originally a web development house but started doing mobile app development in 2016 when we realised we
    could seamlessly transition our web skills to developing mobile apps.
  </p>

  <p> Usually when a business needs to hire mobile app developers it can be expensive because they need to hire IOS app
    developers and Android app developers. React Native allows a write once and deploy everywhere type of setup so the
    client can deal with a single developer who can write code for both platforms.
  </p>


  <h2>Mobile App Developer Team That Works With Select Clients</h2>


  <p> We are selective who we work with. We typically work with businesses who are a little bit overwhelmed by
    technology and want to work with a team who can keep things simple for them.</p>

  <p>We aim to work with businesses who are as serious about their business as we are about ours.
  </p>
