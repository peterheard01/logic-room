  <h1 class="center"> Web Application Development Services, Reading, Berkshire & London </h1>

  <p> We are a small, efficient and highly selective web based application development company in Reading, Berkshire. Our capabilities are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>AngularJS Development Services</li>
    <li>Angular 2 Development Services</li>
    <li>React Development Services</li>
    <li>JavaScript Development Services</li>
    <li>Typescript Development Services</li>
    <li>Single Page Application Development Services</li>
  </ul>

  <p> We are run by software developers that are authors, <a target="_blank" href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7576-tdd-simplified-in-5-steps">speakers</a> and prolific writers. The number one thing we care about is that our clients actually get what they pay for. We don’t create poor quality web software which needs to be re-written every 5-10 years. </p>

  <p> This means that the way we work with you and build your web software is optimised for speed and quality whilst delivering you results. These can be translated into improved profits. We are passionate about our clients taking advantage of web technologies to increase growth. </p>

  <h2 class="text-dark-grey"> Bespoke Web App Development Services </h2>

  <p> We are experts in creating durable and flexible web software based on the emerging <a href="/javascript-is-the-future-of-application-development/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> ecosystem of technologies.
    We develop full stack web apps and single page applications (SPA). We publish articles on <a href="/how-to-architect-enterprise-single-page-applications-part1/" target="_blank">SPA architecture</a>.</p>

  <p> We are also leaders in Rapid Application Development (RAD) techniques that help our clients prototype their ideas with us and learn fast.</p>

  <p> We enable our clients to grow their business faster because we actually work with on them on projects and take the time to challenge and test assumptions about what will work. Software development is expensive; we help you control costs by delivering software that will actually be used.</p>

  <h2 class="text-dark-grey">Custom Web Software Development Team</h2>

  <p> We got fed up working for organisations and software consultancies that didn’t really care or understand what it takes to create well-engineered web applications that can scale to meet long term digital strategies.</p>

  <p> We worked on projects that failed because they were run by businessmen not software engineers. Software development for us is about creating value that will underpin our client’s profitable business.</p>

  <p> So in 2011 we decided to set up our own web consultancy which places two things at the centre of what we do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      when we work with you we keep things simple using lightweight processes like “automated testing” and “regular feedback” to make sure we are efficient; this is known to many as Agile software development. In our world it’s called ‘common sense’.
    </li>

    <li>

      we stand by our commitment to high quality, modular and well-engineered code that reduces risk. Typically, when we develop systems they don’t break all the time which reduces your cost (and headaches).

    </li>

  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-dark-grey"> Web Development Team That Works With Select Clients </h2>

  <p> We work with organisations who are serious about their business and want to have custom web software developed.</p>

  <p> We are selective and won’t work with anyone. We work with clients who we feel share the same values about high quality workmanship and delivering software which will be successful.</p>

  <h2 class="text-dark-grey"> Interested In Working With Us On Your Next Web Based Application? </h2>

  <p> If you are tired of large agencies that promise the earth and don’t deliver and would like to explore working with true software professionals, then get in touch for an initial chat to see if there is a good fit.</p>
