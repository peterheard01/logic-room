### Protecting Your Organisation Against Bad Code

A [study](http://www.castsoftware.com/castresources/materials/wp/cast_2010-annual-report_keyfindings.pdf) by Cast Software performed an audit of 75 code bases found that the average codebase has 347,000 lines of code and this produces approximately $1,055,000 of technical debt or (bad code). 

That is an astonishing financial cost that the average code base has and the best way to ensure high quality code is to stop bad code. By implementing a 3rd party code review you are placing a very clear ring-fence around your investment. The best case scenario is that the code being developed in your organisation is good and nothing needs to be done, the worst case is that it isn't and you are creating a problem by not having a clear quality control policy.

Software is not cheap to produce, it's important that you have a clear policy for quality control because low quality code it will increase your **cost** and your **risk**, read more about this in our  <a href="/the-cost-of-poor-quality-code-on-digital-transformation/" target="_blank">article</a> about code quality in Digital Transformation!

### Can A Code Review Help You?

Bad code isn't the only reason you may want some help with auditing your code, there are a number of reasons an organisation would seek an independent code review or audit. Typically they will fall into one of the following categories : 

1. **Delivery** : Too many bugs, deliveries being too late or perhaps the software idn't meeting the demands of the business, the client has problems and would like to know what to do!
2. **Knowledge/Skills Improvement** : The best way to improve your in-house teams skills are to look at the actual output of their work. A codebase wide review can be used to create a clear action plan for skills and knowledge improvement. This can then be put into an integrated training plan for the team.
2. **Technical** : Need to move to a public or on-prem cloud? Would you like to reconnect your application to different hardware, interfaces or remove legacy dependencies? Perhaps you are having peformance problems? By reviewing your code we can advise you on the costs, complexities and difficulties you may have.
3. **Security** : Cyber security is a big risk to your business and growing by the day. Often clients need a way to ensure that their code base is secure.
