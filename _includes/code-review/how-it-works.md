### How Our Code Review/Audit Process Works in 4 Steps

We provide a service where we can review or audit your code, what we do is take a high level look at your entire code base(s). And produce a report. Dependant on your objectives we work with you moving forward to help you improve. The process works like this...

#### 1. We Identify Your Objectives

We have a conversation with you to establish what exactly you are trying to achieve (detailed above). This is important because it will help us focus on the right area and produce a report which can hone in on the specific area you want to.

#### 2. We Perform the Review

Then we begin the report. The first thing we do is to run some of our automated tools to identify common low level repeated problems this gives us some valuable statistics. Then we audit the code and look for deeper and more complicated issues. These generally work at the architectural level. We write up the report in a word document and deliver it to you.

#### 3. We Compile Your Report

We are reviewing your code against a number of metrics, for code bases where the client is interested in skills improvement for their developers we will look at things like:

- improving automated testing
- developing better and more decoupled architecures
- refining core business and application models
- consolidatng patterns and architecures
- helping to make designs more consistent

For clients that have technical considerations we will look at things like :

- A remediation plan for improving security flaws
- Refactoring options for Cloud migrations
- Advice on Legacy/Infrastructure improvements and some complexity estimations

#### 4. Quarterly Health-checks and On-going Support

Some clients would like to have a monthly, quarterly or bi-annual healthcheck on the status of their code. This can be arranged up front so that checks can be kept up to date. We can review your code on an on going basis and produce a report for you. This allows you to get on with managing the rest of your technical operations knowing that quality control is being handled efficiently.

As a full stack Software Consultancy specialising in the development of high complexity systems with a focus on software code quality we can help you by extending or improving your systems for you.

        <h5> My team already implements code reviews, why would I need this done externally?</h5>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Teams can and often do review code well and manage quality. However by placing quality only 'at the team level' it's hard for an organistion to provide a consistent organisation wide policy on quality control. What is good for one team often isn't for the other, what is important to one team may not be even known by another. Having a higher level of reviewing helps to connect these dots. It **is** possible to create a consistent policy on Object Oriented code. There are fundamental rules and principles that govern the design of code. This is why you would invest in a code review, to create better consistency and quality across your code bases.</p>

<p>Added to this staff can and often do leave. Typical 1-3 month notice periods often do not leave enough time for total knowledge about code bases to be handed over exposing the organisation to even more risk. By working with us on an ongoing basis you can reduce risk and protect your investment.</p>

        <h5>How much does this cost?</h5>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>This is dependant on the size of the code base and the client objectives.</p>

    <p>We do provide a **fixed price** review for clients which will give a an overall health check and look for major problems. For clients that have specific concerns we look deeper into the code and we will be able to provide a more specific quote. </p>

<div class="answer">
<p>This is dependant on the client objectives and our current work-load but typically it will take 1-3 weeks for a normal code review to take place. This can be done sooner if there are pressing issues.</p>

        <h5>We plan on re-writing our applications, is this relevant?</h5>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>By doing a proper audit of the code 'before' you rewrite it you may find that you don't need the rewrite and can simply modernise your code. Secondly if you have already started rewriting then auditing the code is an excellent way to make sure it is done to a high standard.</p>
