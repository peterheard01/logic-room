              You can't rapidly transform your business without high code quality code. We specialise in producing well engineered Object Oriented code which can be extended and maintained. We use a mix
              of our own software design principles coupled with industry recognised practices such as Xtreme Programming (XP). We donâ€™t just lump in buzzwords for the sake of it,
              we take care to make sure that everything we do is based around optimising team performance and output in a way that controls <strong>risk</strong>.

            <h3 class="title white-text">Test Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
            <p class="white-text">
              It's not enough for us to put a practice into a development workflow without mastering it first. We have given countless talks and presentations on the deep synergy between advanced software
              design and the application of automated testing. We use a unique blend of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD) to ensure our output of working software is optimised to
              deliver well tested systems for the lowest <strong>cost</strong> possible.
