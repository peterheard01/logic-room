### Bad Code
Bad quality code is a serious problem. For any organisation looking to scale an ambitious digital strategy requires not just the best in sales, marketing and operations but it requires the best from it's technology. More and more organisations are finding their technology is dependant on software code. Customer engagement, operational efficiency, security and complicance all have a dependency on the code at the heart of your digital operations...

### Protecting Your Organisation Against Bad Code

A [study](http://www.castsoftware.com/castresources/materials/wp/cast_2010-annual-report_keyfindings.pdf) by Cast Software performed an audit of 75 code bases found that the average codebase has 347,000 lines of code and this produces approximately $1,055,000 of technical debt or (bad code). 

That is an astonishing financial cost that the average code base has and the best way to ensure high quality code is to stop bad code. By implementing a 3rd party code review you are placing a very clear ring-fence around your investment. The best case scenario is that the code being developed in your organisation is good and nothing needs to be done, the worst case is that it isn't and you are creating a problem by not having a clear quality control policy.

Software is not cheap to produce, it's important that you have a clear policy for quality control because low quality code it will increase your **cost** and your **risk**, read more about this in our  <a href="/the-cost-of-poor-quality-code-on-digital-transformation/" target="_blank">article</a> about code quality in Digital Transformation!

### Do You Need a Code Review?

Bad code isn't the only reason you may want some help with auditing your code, there are a number of reasons an organisation would seek an independent code review or audit. Typically they will fall into one of the following categories : 

1. **Delivery** : Too many bugs, deliveries being too late or perhaps the software idn't meeting the demands of the business, the client has problems and would like to know what to do!
2. **Knowledge/Skills Improvement** : The best way to improve your in-house teams skills are to look at the actual output of their work. A codebase wide review can be used to create a clear action plan for skills and knowledge improvement. This can then be put into an integrated training plan for the team.
2. **Technical** : Need to move to a public or on-prem cloud? Would you like to reconnect your application to different hardware, interfaces or remove legacy dependencies? Perhaps you are having peformance problems? By reviewing your code we can advise you on the costs, complexities and difficulties you may have.
3. **Security** : Cyber security is a big risk to your business and growing by the day. Often clients need a way to ensure that their code base is secure.

### How Our Code Review and Audit Report Service Works

We provide a service where we can review or audit your code, what we do is take a high level look at your entire code base(s). And produce a report. Dependant on your objectives we work with you moving forward to help you improve. The process works like this...

#### 1. Identifying Objectives

We have a conversation with you to establish what exactly you are trying to achieve (detailed above). This is important because it will help us focus on the right area and produce a report which can hone in on the specific area you want to.

#### 2. Producing The Report

Then we begin the report. The first thing we do is to run some of our automated tools to identify common low level repeated problems this gives us some valuable statistics. Then we audit the code and look for deeper and more complicated issues. These generally work at the architectural level. We write up the report in a word document and deliver it to you.

#### 3. Report Output

We are reviewing your code against a number of metrics, for code bases where the client is interested in skills improvement for their developers we will look at things like:

- improving automated testing
- developing better and more decoupled architecures
- refining core business and application models
- consolidatng patterns and architecures
- helping to make designs more consistent

For clients that have technical considerations we will look at things like :

- A remediation plan for improving security flaws
- Refactoring options for Cloud migrations
- Advice on Legacy/Infrastructure improvements and some complexity estimations

#### 4. Quartely Healthchecks and On-going Supprt

Some clients would like to have a monthly, quarterly or bi-annual healthcheck on the status of their code. This can be arranged up front so that checks can be kept up to date. We can review your code on an on going basis and produce a report for you. This allows you to get on with managing the rest of your technical operations knowing that quality control is being handled efficiently.

As a full stack Software Consultancy specialising in the development of high complexity systems with a focus on software code quality we can help you by extending or improving your systems for you.

### FAQ

##### Who perfroms the audit and compiles the report?

A Logic Room Technical Lead / Software Consultant to perform compile the report. On the rare occasion we are working with niche technology we may work with our external network. 

You can see more about how we work as a consultancy and how skilled our technical leads are by watching our video <a class="popup-youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZPrftWLfrc">here</a>

#### But my team(s) already implements code reviews, why would I need this done externally?

Teams can and often do review code well and manage quality. However by placing quality only 'at the team level' it's hard for an organistion to provide a consistent organisation wide policy on quality control. What is good for one team often isn't for the other, what is important to one team may not be even known by another. Having a higher level of reviewing helps to connect these dots. It **is** possible to create a consistent policy on Object Oriented code. There are fundamental rules and principles that govern the design of code. This is why you would invest in a code review, to create better consistency and quality across your code bases.

Added to this staff can and often do leave. Typical 1-3 month notice periods often do not leave enough time for total knowledge about code bases to be handed over exposing the organisation to even more risk. By working with us on an ongoing basis you can reduce risk and protect your investment.

#### How much does this cost?

This is dependant on the size of the code base and the client objectives.

We do provide a **fixed price** review for clients which will give a an overall health check and look for major problems. For clients that have specific concerns we look deeper into the code and we will be able to provide a more specific quote. 

#### How long will it take?

This is dependant on the client objectives and our current work-load but typically it will take 1-3 weeks for a normal code review to take place. This can be done sooner if there are pressing issues.

#### If we have problems can you help us fix them?

Of course, as a full stack development consultancy that specialise in high quality maintainable code we can provide ongoing development and support for your enterprise applications.
