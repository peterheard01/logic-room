    <h4 class="center">Digital Transformation From The Experts 'Doing Software Properly'</h4>

    <br>
    <br>


    <p>We are a UK based software consultancy that builds cross platform (web, mobile, desktop and server) software for organisations that are serious about digital transformation.</p>


    <p>The number one thing we care about is creating well-engineered systems that scale to meet our clients long term digital strategies; no matter how complex.</p>

    <p>Our company was founded because we realised that there was a gap in the market when it came to dealing with the enormous cost of poor quality code along with the exponential complexity organisations experience when custom software isn't built or maintained properly. You can read more about the financial cost of poorly built systems <a target="_blank" href="/the-cost-of-poor-quality-code-on-digital-transformation/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>We work with technology leaders and businesses that are a little bit frustrated by software development and want to work with a team they can trust do do the job properly. They are perhaps little bit tired of industry buzzwords and want to work with software professionals who will protect their investment and enable them to do what they need to; transform their business.</p>

    <p>We are in the business of reducing your <strong>cost</strong> and <strong>risk</strong> and we stand against bad code!</p>

    <p>If this simple message of professionalism resonates with you the next thing to do is to call our founder Pete on 07889 812 612 to see if we share the same values.</p>
